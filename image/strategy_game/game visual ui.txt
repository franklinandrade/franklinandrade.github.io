Ok, I've selected a few key screens, this is the old UI, so there's no problem in sharing it with you only for the purpose of the interviewing process.

They are in "Retina" size, so if you have any new iPad around you can see it directly on the device, instead of imagining it, I kept working on Photoshop and testing the design on the devices after having some progress.

The process here was quite straightforward, we had a roadmap of features that were going to be developed, so it was key to maintain the screen unclutered and give most of the screen for the map and the units/buildings (the game is very similar to clash of clans) while acknowledging space for new interface controls and such. 

These graphics + aesthetics went through several iterations, and are not current with what will be released, mostly because of testing with real players.
