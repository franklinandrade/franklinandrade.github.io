                        <p class="single_column">InteractionCraft is a one-man design consultancy focused on helping entrepreneurs, startups and small to medium companies with design in their business. Did this by providing high quality feedback and advice about digital product strategy, usability, visual and interaction design.</p>
                        <p class="">For building InteractionCraft I studied the freelance UX consultancy market, understood what was being offered by other designers, developed a pair of MVP experiments to test my own vision, iterated the business model and the business strategy, got a clear vision of what potential clients needed and what I could offer, developed a website to clearly speak about my offering and created a deliverable document format that included an initial design analysis, a list of design problems, a list of design "quick wins" and design advice in the form of a "top design recommendation".</p>

                        <h2>Initial analysis</h2>
                        <p class="single_column">After checking out few fellow freelance UX designers that offered usability and design reviews, I decided to answer the following questions about how I wanted to proceed:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>What are my broad aspirations for my "organisation"? and Which are the concrete goals against progress would be measured?</li>
                            <li>Where are am I going to play? Where am I not playaing?</li>
                            <li>How will I win again competition in the playfield?</li>
                            <li>Wich capabilities should I build and maintained?</li>
                            <li>Which management systems for operation will I need to build and maintain those capabilities?</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>This took several days of thinking, understanding what should I do. My answers became more specific and shorter as I iterated my ideas and vision, there were a total of 9 iterations</p>
                        <p>This is a capture of my first 5 iterations:</p>

                    <div class="text_block">
                        <h2>Marketing content and Website design </h2>
                        <p class="single_column">Before even deciding on colours, typography or layout I wrote the whole marketing message to be used in the website, as my vision and ideas evolved so did the content.</p>
                        <p>Initially I went for a consulting service with 3 distinct aspects with not-so-original catchy names:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Express Feedback:</strong> A short review of a client's petition, delivered as a text-only email, short and quick.</li>
                            <li><strong>Direct Advice Report:</strong> A more elaborate feedback, with complete design critique and advice for improvement, delivered as a PDF Report.</li>
                            <li><strong>UX Design Consultation:</strong> Generic services for clients that could ask for more than the previous ones.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>This is a sample of how those websites and messages where initially conceived, in terms of visual design, typogramy, colour, message, etc.:</p>

                        <p>I didn't felt happy about it, after some deliberation with friends and potential customers decided to cut all services and focus on the design critique and advice.</p>
                        <p>The reasons I found for getting rid of most of the service offering was:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Potentially too much work for a single person, If all 3 services got sold at the same time I would be in knee-deep work and zero life.</li>
                            <li>Express Feedback was too shallow, almost everyone I asked seemed uninterested in my initial offer.</li>
                            <li>Remote consultation would require a lot of work creating project proposals.</li>

                        <p>These are the 2 websites with the new offer called <strong>UX Feedback Report</strong>, the all-white was my MVP, it really caught the attention of a few companies, I also created a logo that got changed into the pixel-like squares in a circle (InteractionCraft initials) and changed the design and service offer of the website, here can be seen both:</p>
