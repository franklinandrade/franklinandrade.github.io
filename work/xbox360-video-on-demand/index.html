                        <p class="">A well known spanish startup approached the company I was working at that time with the inquietude of porting their service onto various platforms, being Xbox one of our specialties we proceeded to understand their business, the solution and imagined a way to translate their online web service onto an Xbox 360 Application using Metro Style.</p>

                        <h2>Project Kick off</h2>
                        <p>Work began by analysing all the research data that had been available to us, it helped me understand their market, target audiences, service offering, business goals, etc.</p>
                        <p>I conducted an internal workshop at our company where we got to define the essential service and interaction elements that were going to make it to the Xbox version, not all the service could be adapted and developed for the first iteration.</p>
                        <p>At first we asked ourselves different versions of this: "Can [Client name] afford not to do [feature name] and still stay in business and be competitive?"</p>
                        <p>After reaching a list of features, we proceeded to estimate the weigh of each feature and how hard it would be to develop it, also how important each feature was for the business and how attractive it would be for its users</p>
                        <p>Our initial insights are partially documented in this pages:</p>
