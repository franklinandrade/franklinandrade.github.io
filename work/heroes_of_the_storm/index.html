                        <p class="single_column">I'm a fan of all the things <a href="http://www.blizzard.com" target="_blank">Blizzard Entertainment</a> does, played and loved most of their <a href="http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/games/legacy/" target="_blank">older games</a> like: Blackthorne, The Lost Vikings, Warcraft Orcs &amp; Humans, Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness (including expansions) and Diablo; on their more <a href="http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/games/" target="_blank">recent games</a>: Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos (inc. expansions), Starcraft (inc. Brood War), Starcraft II: Wings of Liberty &amp; Heart of the Swarm, World of Warcraft (including Wrath of the Lich King, Burning Crusade, Cataclysm &amp; Pandaria, 2005 - 2012), Diablo II. Very recently Hearthstone and finally Heroes of the Storm.</p>
                        <p><a href="http://eu.battle.net/heroes/en/" target="_blank">Heroes of the Storm</a> really caught my attention; the chance of playing with a lot of the characters from fantasy worlds that I know and love with other people was just too exciting and proved incredibly fun; applied for the early Alpha and had the luck of being selected for testing the game really early!</p>
                        <p>I Played from Alpha until Launch, and had to stop since my iMac (early 2008) just can't handle the game requirements anymore. Pity... :-(</p>
                        <p>During the Alpha through Launch had the chance to study the game's evolution in balancing, user interface, information architecture, navigation, character development, map development and more; the large texts, big menu options, large buttons... that was just a huge invitation for me to try and port the game UI to a mobile device.... so I did something simple, this is my work log.</p>

                        <h2>Work Log</h2>
                        <h3>Day 1</h3>
                        <p><img src="../../image/heroes_of_the_storm/heroes_loading.jpg"></p>
                        <p>Played with a few Hero characters, had some difficulty using the right keys, thought of how to translate that difficulty to the tablet version.</p>
                        <p>Had the idea of playing with 3 heroes: one i'm very familiar with, one more or less and one completely unknown and observe my learning difficulties.</p>
                        <p>Checked <a href="http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/company/legal/ugc-legal.html" target="_blank">Blizzard's terms on User generated content</a>, perhaps my projects can be considered fan art? to be defined.</p>
                        <p>Had the idea of making different prototypes to study different design aspects, to be defined.</p>
                        <p>Had the idea of implementing a dragging interaction the game map with two fingers on a touchscreen, tap/hold to start/aim power cast with tap for stopping cast, while tap/hold all the UI controls become transparent.</p>
                        <p><strong>Note to self:</strong> I feel that I can do the Interaction Design and aint afraid to code, but I prefer to code selectively. If things can be achieved without coding I won't do any code, the with this project is to make a prototype to get the message get across the team, not making amazing prototypes that will impress without needing them to do so.</p>
                        <p>Noticed that I should make my own assets for the visual prototype.</p>
                        <hr/>

                        <h3>Day 2</h3>
                        <p>Went throught the prototypes paper and decided to go with a dual implementation / visual approach and a visual only approach, then an integrated final version.</p>
                        <p>Defined the problem: <strong>"How might we approach gameplay and UI controls for Heroes of the Storm on a mobile device?".</strong></p>
                        <p>Sketched a layout with some ""game event triggers"" buttons.</p>
                        <p>Defined a roadmap and described each stage milestones, purpose, goals, insights, etc. it looked like this: <img src="../../image/heroes_of_the_storm/roadmap_notes.jpg"></p>
                        <p>Searched for vainglory's UI screenshots and ended checking a bit of the forums for ""UI & Graphics"" Category.</p>
                        <p>Searched the Final Fantasy UI for layout ideas.</p>
                        <p>Decided to make some paper prototypes for studying layout options.</p>
                        <p>Played and took some screenshots, watched the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rXgFyY-4Js" target="_blank">game intro/tutorial video</a> for unexpeted ideas.</p>
                        <p>Made a visual inventory of the Play UI elements.</p>
                        <p>Played again and took more screenshots :)</p>
                        <p>Drew the inventory of elements in sticky notes and cutted them so I could use them in configuring layouts in paper sheets. <img src="../../image/heroes_of_the_storm/inventory_stickynotes.jpg"></p>
                        <p>Had the idea of double tapping for attack-move.</p>
                        <p>Finished drawing the elements on sticky notes and cutted them to their contour. <img src="../../image/heroes_of_the_storm/all_elements.jpg"></p>
                        <p>Did several variations of element placement and took pictures, with the goal of just trying to get new ideas for a better layout for mobile, I prefer thinking "slow and take my time to enjoy this and resist the urge and bad habit of jumping to digital right away.</p>
                        <p>In around 15 minutes I had checked 9 different layouts for the UI, these are the options:</p>
                        <img src="../../image/heroes_of_the_storm/nine_layouts.jpg">
                        <p><br>Tried their original layout idea, I liked it more than my own variations:</p><p><img src="../../image/heroes_of_the_storm/00_original.jpg"></p>
                        <p>Decided to do this instead of only scribbling and sketching in paper o in my iPad, I could generate more options this way, also it was a great judgement-deferral exercise.</p>
                        <p>Started doing the layout of screen elements in Photoshop and mirrored it to the iPad with <a href="https://bjango.com/mac/skalapreview/" target="_blank">Skala Preview</a>.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="text_block light">
                        <h3>Day 3</h3>
                        <p>Finished the layout of screen UI elements in Photoshop and checked that all all the sizes are good for touch controls, this was my wireframe: </p>
                        <p><img src="../../image/heroes_of_the_storm/wireframe_sizes.jpg"></p>
                        <p>Compared the sizes that I chose with the sizes used in HOTS and realized that they are almost of the same size, that hints me of a possible launch of Heroes of the Storm on iOS devices:</p>
                        <p><img src="../../image/heroes_of_the_storm/comparison_sizes.jpg"></p>
                        <p>Adjusted the initial size of elements for iPad screens, based in that previous comparison</p>
                        <p>Selected the mobile breakpoints and started making the HTML layout</p>
                        <p>Did the first part of the layout-only in html</p>
                        <p>Advanced on the layout-only html, couln't do much since I ended up watching Apple's keynote and took note of the new iPad Pro screen Resolution of 2732 x 2046, that means 1366px X 1024px of device resolution and actually having some idea of how this might look on an iPad Pro.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="text_block">
                        <h3>Day 4</h3>
                        <p>Finished the layout-only prototype.</p>
                        <p>Added a new breakpoint for resolutions larger than 2000px wide.</p>
                        <p>Added new steps to my workflow to manage the adjustments that should be done if there are more than 1 breakpoints.</p>
                        <p>Tested it in my iPads, TV, on the Desktop looks like this:</p>
                        <p><img src="../../image/heroes_of_the_storm/layout_prototype.jpg"></p>
                        <p>Compared the sizes at multiple resolutions with the original interface, quite close :)</p>
                        <p>Started to make the visual style items in photoshop, worked the Hexagon first, did this:</p>
                        <img src="../../image/heroes_of_the_storm/hexagon_rebuild.jpg">
                    </div>
                    <div class="text_block dark">
                        <h3>Day 5</h3>
                        <p>Made a vectorial version of the UI separated in layers in Photoshop, it wasn't working, so did the vectors in Flash, it looked like this before exporting back to Photoshop:</p>
                        <p><img src="../../image/heroes_of_the_storm/flash_vectors.jpg"></p>
                        <p>Advanced on recomposing the panel in layers and base colours.</p>
                        <p>Added borders, shadows, highlights by PS layer effects.</p>
                        <p>Added higlights and shadows by handpainting using my super trusty wacom tablet.</p>
                        <p>Finished the panel, the z &amp; b buttons too.</p>
                        <p>This is the end result before exporting to the prototype:</p>
                        <img src="../../image/heroes_of_the_storm/bottom_bar.jpg">
                    </div>
                    <div class="text_block light">
                        <h3>Day 6</h3>
                        <p>Made the top panel with timer and team colours, also made the level bars, looking like this:</p>
                        <img src="../../image/heroes_of_the_storm/top_bars.jpg"><br><br>
                        <p>Made the portrait and health/mana bars, the portrait frame was not a simple thing to do, looking like this:</p>
                        <p><img src="../../image/heroes_of_the_storm/portrait.jpg"></p>
                        <p>Made the top respawn bars.</p>
                        <p>Started to rebuild the prototype again since it was totally broken with the new art"</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="text_block ">
                        <h3>Day 7</h3>
                        <p>Restarted the prototype with the new art.</p>
                        <p>Finished the top panel in the prototype.</p>
                        <p>Removed the 600px breakpoint, too much work!</p>
                        <p>Removed the Spawn bars, too complex and didn't added much.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="text_block light">
                        <h3>Day 8</h3>
                        <p>Restarted the prototype again, keeps coming apart when working in breakpoints. :(</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="text_block dark">
                        <h3>Day 9</h3>
                        <p>Remade the prototype again, left out the talents and numerical cast buttons, it is ready for touch integration!</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="text_block light">
                        <h3>Day 10</h3>
                        <p>Researched for ways to handle touch in html5</p>
                        <p>Tried Hammer.js, discarded, too complex.</p>
                        <p>Tried plain html touch events, not conclusive, discarded.</p>
                        <p>Tried <a href="http://touchpunch.furf.com/" target="_blank">Touchpunch</a>, decided to use this one!.</p>
                        <p>Implemented a test with Touchpunch: panning a div with a image bg with constrained area of movement.</p>
                        <p>Implement the map panning with Touchpunch and iterate later with HTML touch events.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="text_block dark">
                        <h3>Day 11</h3>
                        <p>Implemented the map panning, initially tried to devise a mathematical way to center viewport, image and boundaries but noticed it was a complex idea for something too simple.</p>
                        <p>Decided to work the maths for triple centering as a posible blog post.</p>
                        <p>Used a battleground map tile images from Google Images.</p>
                        <p>Made a single image with the stolen battleground map separate jpg files, used it as a background for the prototype.</p>
                        <p>Added the different breakpoints indicator at the top left.</p>
                        <p>Tested it again in an iPhone, iPads and Smart TV Browser. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVKjkPOyNZk" target="_blank">Job's done!</a> :-)</p>
