                        <p>This concept's purpose is to define an easier way to allow groups of people to share and track any kind of publications.</p>
                        <p>Its vision is that Individuals can perform some of the functions of librarians by being aware of the library dynamics and other's needs; loaning, returning and commenting without a librarian role might be possible.</p>

                        <h4>Facts</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Began by annotating most of the things I had in my head, this would help me separate the facts &amp; concepts by identifying which are obvious + redundant and which are relevant for the design problem.</li>
                            <li>Writing out my vision and perceived facts helps me make new connections and ideas.</li>
                            <li>Later, results are grouped in the 'Goals &amp; Wishes' and 'Insights' lists.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Goals &amp; Wishes, Insights</h4>
                        <p>The goal here isn't quantity or quality, is exploration and discovery of possibilities:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Feasible "corporate" goals.</li>
                            <li>Key actors and roles in the product architecture.</li>
                            <li>Possible key features in the product.</li>

                        <h3><strong>Step 2</strong><br> Concept Mapping, Visualising the components</h3>
                        <h4>Concept maps / Idea architecture</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Reader &amp; Librarian roles.</li>
                            <li>Loans and wish lists.</li>
                            <li>Available publications list.</li>
                            <li>The bookshelf.</li>
                            <li>Publications reviews.</li>
                            <li>The office / organization.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h4>Why I made concept maps so early?</h4>
                        <p>To help me articulate better the idea, to inform my intuition, for imagining technical and design constraints that could surface:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Library's components are identified earlier.</li>
                            <li>Became aware of multiple relationships between components.</li>
                            <li>These relationships help shape user roles &amp; system objects.</li>
                            <li>Provides additional sense to previous and new insights, helps me visualize other ideas.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Identifying ideas, relationships, values, etc.</h4>
                        <p>This free list helped me by making explicit new stuff it was more a "keep track of this" list:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What takes place between people interested in the same books / topics?</li>
                            <li>Which things are relevant for buying / loaning books?</li>
                            <li>Which values &amp; beliefs determine the rules for loaning, returning, using books and publications?</li>
                            <li>What is the most basic information handled when looking for a publication?</li>
                            <li>Are social interactions relevant when loaning books?</li>
                            <li>Which of them are more influential? When?</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3><strong>Step 4</strong><br> Service/User Journey Development</h3>
                        <p><img src="../../image/library_management/portfolioAstinusRethink03.jpg"></p>
                        <p>Decided to structure the insight in 4 time-based stages:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Emergency of needs:</strong> What takes place when readers have these needs? How these needs come to be? How can people relate to their needs?</li>
                            <li><strong>Service engagement:</strong> What happens when they get in contact and still havn't used anything? How they came to this service? Have they showed interest? How did it manifested in actions?</li>
                            <li><strong>Actual usage:</strong> How have people used the service? Are they using it as intended? Shortcuts? Have they taken any physical evidence with them?</li>
                            <li><strong>Post usage:</strong> Were user needs fulfilled? Why/When/How? Why is the service not being used at this time? How can it be of further help?</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>And for each stage I came to think of:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Facts:</strong> discovered insights in form of factual information.</li>
                            <li><strong>Challenges:</strong> opportunities that could be translated into interaction flows and features.</li>
                            <li><strong>Ideas:</strong> ideas for: features, new interactions, information patterns, touchpoints, etc.</li>
                            <li><strong>Frontstage:</strong> the 'human face' of the process, direct interaction with people.</li>
                            <li><strong>Artifacts:</strong> devices, documents, technology, furniture, etc. that allow interacting with the process and system.</li>
                            <li><strong>Backstage:</strong> processes that the Public Users do not directly perceive but have influence in their experience</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3><strong>Step 5</strong><br> Scenarios, Envisioning situations &amp; outcomes</h3>
                        <p>Made this proof-test scenarios after braindumping most of my ideas, writing allowed me to cover the different variations of events that could take place within the early idea.</p>
                        <h4>Scenarios</h4>
                        <p>These helped me visualize:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Where can the library be accessed and from where, places and devices.</li>
                            <li>What information could be relevant and in which cases.</li>
                            <li>How could people communicate regarding events related to book loans, returns, waiting and such.</li>
                            <li>Emotions and opportunities for channelling them.</li>
                            <li>Possibilities regarding Reading &amp; loaning habits.</li>
                            <li>Real spaces and locations for the shelf, even Librarians.</li>
                            <li>Modes and states, for publications and users.</li>
                            <li>Additional Product / Service features.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>First ideas for features</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Where can the library be accessed and from places and devices.</li>

                        <h4>Feature Mapping</h4>
                        <p>By analyzing the scenarios, journey matrix and concept diagrams, surfaced a general set features the service could have.</p>
                        <p>Each set goes from most essential to least essential, from basic functionalities to accesory delighters.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Musts:</strong> This is the core of the service's functionality, without any of these features the system doesn't work.</li>
                            <li><strong>Nice to have:</strong> Things work and run without these, but there might be some inconveniences, perhaps perceived as rigidity.</li>
                            <li><strong>Optionals:</strong> These makes the experience go better by being available in the right moment.</li>
                            <li><strong>Interesting:</strong> Basic delighers, makes things feel nicer.</li>
                            <li><strong>Differentiators:</strong> This is the awesomeness, aimed at delivering superior delight.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Separating each feature into sets allowed a clearer picture of how the solution should interact and also be developed.</p>
                        <p>The next step is specifying what is to be built, and in which order.</p>

                        <h4>Core functionalities</h4>
                        <p>Wrote the user stories for the first work sprint from the feature set called "Must Have", there are 8 features from this Core features set and 17 user stories for creating all this features.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Information:</strong> Loan or return detail, Title detail, User detail, Reserve title for future loan, Review title.</li>
                            <li><strong>Listings:</strong> List of available titles, List of loaned titles, List of loan reservations per title, A title's previous readers list, List of recently loaned titles.</li>
                            <li><strong>Loaning &amp; returning:</strong> Loan titles, Return loaned titles.</li>

                        <h4>Roles and Objects</h4>
                        <p>Defined the User roles and Data objects to be used in the functional elements, not in software programming, but in Interaction design.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>User Roles:</strong> Functions that a person can assume when using the system.</strong>
                            <li><strong>Data Objects:</strong> The things the users can create, manipulate, look for, etc.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>This specifies the limits of what can be designed for, in form of discrete functions operated by a User Role on an Object.</p>
                        <h4>Who, what, where &amp; how...</h4>
                        <p>For having a good grasp of what can be done when designing the functional interface elements I define these too:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Functions per Role:</strong> Enumerates what can a Librarian user &amp; a Reader user do.</li>
                            <li><strong>Functions per Object:</strong> Describes the actions that can be performed with Publications, Users and Loans.</li>
                            <li><strong>Data per Object:</strong> Specifies the information that belongs to Publications, to Users and to Loans.</li>

                        <p>This is the first prototype, decided to draw everything in my iPad.</p>
                        <p>Created the sketches using Adobe Ideas and an Ozaki O!tool Stylus R.</p>
                        <p>Exported the drawings, cropped them in Photoshop and uploaded them to Dropbox, then made an interactive version with Marvel App, it worked amazingly well for a service in open beta.</p>
                        <p>Tested this first version with a couple of friends, which made a few complains and comments and proceeded to make them into the second version...</p>

                        <h4>Interactive Prototype 2</h4>
                        <p><input type="button" class="view_prototype_button" onclick="" value="View Prototype 2"></p>
                        <p>The second version includes the previously gathered feedback.</p>
                        <p>Edited everything in Adobe Ideas and PS, but the interaction flow wasn't totally clear, so this wireflow helped me understand what was missing.</p>
                        <p>It was made in Omnigraffle, took around 1.5 hours of work.</p>
                        <p>Made changes to the main "Bookshelf", added confirmations, and a more clear interaction flow, it took around 2 hours of work.</p>
